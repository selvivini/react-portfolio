        Hi Everyone! My name is Vinitha, I am from India. I was graduated with the masters degree in Business administration from India. I started my career working for hsbc bank as a loan officer in the retail Assets processing team. Then soon after my marriage I moved to united States with my husband who is working as an IT consultant for USDA(Nitc) data center. I live in Overland Park, KS since 2011. I have a financial background and coding was entirely new to me. I developed interest towards writing web content when I started to do write some food blogs. I started working with wordpress(CMS). Then slowly I started learning web technologies like html and css. I didnâ€™t get my work permit until 2015. So I started to work for an Indian software company in remote which is located in my home town where I was a part in developing some of their Ui portions for their clients.
       Slowly then I started with the basics of javascript  and learnt Javascript frameworks like Reactjs, Angularjs and mobile frameworks like Ionic and React Native.
